Free Gift With Purchase
A small, unexpected extra can be a wonderful, cost-effective, way to make a customer feel good as they check out. Emazing Lights adds a free, lightweight item that doesnâ€™t impact shipping costs and can fit into flat rate containers for customers who reach a certain purchase threshold.

How does it work?
Define the Product ID of the free gift you want to give away for qualifying purchases on line two using FREE_GIFT_PRODUCT_ID
Change the message you want to displayed to qualifying customers on line 13
Line 5 checks that there is more than 1 item in the cart in order to qualify
Customers with at least one regular item and the gift in their cart, will see the gift discounted to $0
This script requires the customer to manually add the free gift to their cart. Providing a pop up or automatic messaging to customers when they qualify for a free gift would require a different script and the required JavaScript modification to your theme.
